# Jigsaw-puzzle
A jigsaw puzzle is a popular type of puzzle game where a picture is broken down into many small interlocking pieces that must be arranged in the correct order to form the original image. In the context of computer vision, the goal is to develop algorithms that can automatically solve jigsaw puzzles.

The task of solving a jigsaw puzzle using computer vision can be broken down into several sub-tasks. The first step is to detect the individual puzzle pieces and extract them from the image. This can be done using techniques such as edge detection, contour detection, or blob detection.

Once the pieces have been extracted, the next step is to determine their orientation and position relative to each other. This can be achieved by analyzing the shape, color, and texture of the pieces, as well as any unique features or patterns that may be present on the pieces.

Finally, the extracted pieces must be assembled into the correct order to form the original image. This can be done by using various algorithms such as graph-based matching, template matching, or deep learning-based methods.

Overall, solving a jigsaw puzzle using computer vision requires a combination of image processing techniques, pattern recognition, and machine learning algorithms. The ability to solve jigsaw puzzles automatically has many potential applications, including image and video processing, robotics, and gaming.
